This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Tcl string comparison within a procedure. The `bug.tcl` file contains a procedure with an incorrect string comparison. The `bugSolution.tcl` file provides the corrected version.  The error arises from using the `==` operator instead of the `eq` operator for comparing strings, which leads to unexpected behavior when an empty string is involved. This example highlights the importance of using the appropriate string comparison operator in Tcl to avoid unexpected results.
